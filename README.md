# voting-system
This is a simple project in which firstly you will put names of two nominees who are taking part in election.
After that you have to select a number from 1 to 11 which will be your voter id.
Once you select your voter id it will ask you whom to vote (here nominee 1 or nominee 2).
Once all the 11 users have casted the vote You will be able to see which nominee won the election
